                    <p>Ever wondered what makes someone a good leader, a good athlete, or a good competitor? Why do some people accomplish their goals while others fail? Why are some people more successful than others?</p>
                    
                    <p>We usually look towards top performing people to attempt to discover their secrets and we usually attribute their success to their inherent ability - their natural talent.</p>
                    
                    <p>But we all know there is more to the story than that. It’s an often overlooked element that helps individuals become successful.</p>
                    
                    <p>So, what is it that differentiates them from others? What makes a bigger impact than talent or intelligence?</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Mental toughness</strong></p>   
                    
                    <p>Many studies have shown that your mental toughness plays a more important role than anything else for achieving your goals in health, business, and life. Even more, mental toughness isn’t something you need to be born with, but it’s something you can develop over time.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>But first, what is mental toughness?</strong></p>
                    
                    <blockquote>"Mental toughness" is keeping strong in the face of adversity. It’s the voice in the back of your head that tells you to keep going, keep pushing, and keep trying, even when the going gets tough. It's the ability to keep your focus and determination despite the difficulties you encounter.</blockquote>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why is it important? What does it give you?</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>For me, mental toughness has given me the confidence and belief that I can achieve anything I put my mind to, no matter what obstacles lie ahead and no matter what lack of applicable skills I may have at the moment. Seriously.</p>
                  
                    <p>When I was young, I competed in the International Tennis Federation Junior Circuit and the Canadian Tennis Junior Circuit. Throughout my competitions I encountered many challenges and hardships. All of which allowed me to improve as a tennis player and overall as an individual. Tennis is an individual sport, which means you are out there alone facing all the challenges. Challenges such as your opponent, pressure, crowds, weather, injuries, etc. You don’t have anyone out there giving you advice, telling you what you’re doing wrong, giving you a break, encouraging you, etc. Moreover, every top player has roughly the same set of skills. They have great power, speed, stamina, tactics, equipment, etc. So then what puts people over the edge and makes them better than the others? I was always trying to figure this question out. At the beginning of my junior tennis career I was oftentimes losing to players who I feel I should’ve beaten. They were always playing the important points better than I was and this often led to their success over me. Because of this, I struggled to even make it to the Canadian Junior National Tournament - a goal I was trying to achieve for almost four years.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p>However, from constant failures, lessons, and successes, I learned that to win consistently you need to believe, focus, persevere, and not let anyone get to you mentally. Tennis is as much of a mental game as it is a physical game. You need the ability to accept failure -- to be okay with not getting what you want immediately, but knowing that if you continue to persevere you will be successful. You need to let go of mistakes quickly if things don’t go your way, and understand that it takes time and patience to accomplish things. This is exactly what the top players were doing. They mentally had control over the situation. For example, they knew that they couldn’t expect to win points after one or two great shots, but that they needed to focus long enough to consistently hit more than seven great shots, construct the point, and wait for their opportunity to finish the point off. Realizing this and the other tactics the top players were doing to succeed, I eventually learned and was able to win the Ontario Junior Tennis Provincial Championships twice and place in the top 8 of the Canadian Junior Tennis National Tournament.</p>
                    
                    <p>In essence, you need to be mentally tough, and by developing mental toughness you will tackle any challenge with belief. It will change how you approach anything in your life and will help you be more successful.</p>
           
                    
                    <p>Remember, this doesn’t only apply to tennis. Sports, games, education, jobs, or anything you try to achieve in life is a mental challenge. How you prepare for and deal with every moment, for any of these, is what affects the outcome more than talent.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>So what does it take? How can you develop mental toughness?</strong></p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">4 tactics</h2>
                
                    <h1 class="page-header">Managing Expectations</h1>
                
                    <p>One of the best ways to develop your mental toughness is to manage your expectations. If you poorly manage your expectations, it can make you feel like you have no control of your surroundings and it can overwhelm you. From this, it can be even harder to build mental toughness. In order to ensure that you manage your expectations and don’t fall into this state, it’s crucial to set realistic expectations and to be flexible and adaptable to unexpected situations that may arise when trying to achieve a goal.</p>
                
                    <p>Setting realistic expectations helps you not get ahead of yourself. Getting your hopes up or relying on low-probability outcomes immediately puts you at a disadvantage. If you do fall in this trap, you will tend to overthink about possibilities, you will start playing the “what if” game, and you will lose focus of what you’re trying to overcome at the moment. As a result, unexpected situations can often get the best of you.</p>
                
                    <p>If you look at some of the top leaders or athletes, you’ll find that they are able to absorb unexpected circumstances and remain unphased by them. Moreover, they are still able to maintain humour in tough situations and are able to be flexible enough to think of new ways to solve their problem or achieve their goal. They realize that oftentimes the path to a certain goal isn’t always the path they intended it to be and that they should be prepared for anything that comes their way. For example, just look at the President of the United States, Barack Obama - someone who I look up to greatly and is a great example of someone who exemplifies mental toughness. Not only is he able to roll with the punches, but he is also able to think about how he can overcome those punches and use them to his advantage. Everyday he faces criticism, challenges, and roadblocks, but he realizes that he can’t control everything that comes his way, but he can control how he reacts to them.</p>
                
                    <h1 class="page-header">Keep cool in pressure/heated situations</h1>
                
                    <p>In high pressure situations, or in situations where you realize that your performance needs to be optimal, emotions can often get the best of us and can lead us to overthink, focus on the wrong things, and perform poorly. In times like these, it’s important to have emotional resilience so that you can handle those heavy situations better.</p>
                
                    <p>The way to build this emotional resilience is primarily through experience. The more pressure situations you find yourself in and put yourself in, the better. Step out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself. Each pressure situation will provide you with different circumstances and mental exercises which you will have to try to overcome.</p>
                
                    <p>I look back at my tennis career a lot when it comes to this tactic and reflect upon how it has helped me. In competitive tennis, you play many different types of people. You play high-ranked players (people who are expected to crush you), low-ranked players (people you should definitely beat), and people who are around the same level (winner depends on who is better that day). Each match you’re in provides you with different pressure situations. When in those situations you need to, mentally, figure out how to perform in an optimal manner so that you can win the match. Furthermore, in each situation, the pressure you are faced with is completely different. When I first started playing tennis competitively, I would often fall under pressure and mess up. Rarely would I embrace the moment and perform outstanding enough to win. It was extremely frustrating. When playing high-ranked players I found that it was much easier to play loose, care-free, and with excitement because I had no pressure - nothing to lose. However, when it came to playing people who I should beat or had a high chance of beating, I found that it was more difficult to play well since there was pressure on the line - an opportunity that could slip away and an expectation to win. But after putting myself more and more in those situations, I started to take my failures, analyze them, figure out how I can do better the next time, and practice. Eventually, I turned these uncomfortable situations into comfortable ones and I was able to face unexpected situations with greater ease. Once I developed the right mindset, I was able to play matches with the same level of consistency, in terms of performance, regardless of the type of pressure. Remember, tennis is where I improved on this tactic, but you can learn to handle pressure in several other scenarios whether it’s school, sports, music, dance, etc.</p>
                
                    <h1 class="page-header">Find lessons from your failures and improve upon them</h1>
                
                    <p>In many of these situations you will often encounter failures or outcomes which are not ideal/comfortable. When this happens it’s important to embrace them. One of the biggest things you can do to build that mental fortitude is to <strong>not make excuses for yourself, even if the failure wasn’t your fault. Resist the urge to blame others.</strong> When you make excuses for yourself, you’re running away to seek comfort and make yourself feel better, instead of facing the truth/outcome head on and proving that you can overcome it. Take the lessons from your failures and continue to apply it to the next situation. In cases where it wasn’t your fault, sometimes all you can do is shrug it off and move on. Sometimes outcomes are out of your control and you have to accept that you can only control so much.</p>
                
                    <p>I remember the time when I had an interview with Microsoft and I completely bombed it even though I had all the knowledge to succeed. It was my first ever technical interview and I was extremely excited to have the chance to interview. I prepared for weeks and as hard as I possibly could. When it came time to interview, I was given a series of questions which were valid, fair, computer science questions - questions that I could answer as long as I focused and maintained a clear mind. However, during the interview I was distracted. Distracted by the pressure, the potential possibilities from acing the interview, and distracted from some of the interviewer's actions. As a result, I bombed the interview. I ran out of time, asked poor questions, and didn’t focus on the right components of the question. I was frustrated and sad for a moment because it was an opportunity not taken advantage of - but I knew that I had to get better. I took the failures from the experience, improved upon it, and attempted to put myself more in those situations. Eventually, another opportunity arose for me and it was an interview with Google. So I took those improvements, applied them to the new opportunity, and got the job.</p>
                    
                    <h1 class="page-header">Find that motivation</h1>
                
                    <p>All of the previous things are great to have, but if you don’t have the motivation to continue to push and improve yourself, then it’s difficult to develop that mental toughness. One of the best things you can do to find motivation is ask yourself, why do I need to do [this]? When you ask yourself why, you really try to reach that underlying motivation. “Why do I need to work out?” “So that I can look and feel better?” When you realize why you need to do something it gives you a reason to act upon it. It makes it easier to suck it up and complete that task.</p>
                
                    <p>However, with motivation you also need discipline and willpower. You need this so that you can continue to push forward in difficult times. This takes time to develop, but one excellent way to develop this is by trying to form simple habits. These can be any habits you like, but when you perform the habit give yourself small boosts of positive reinforcement and accomplishment. This will help you maintain the motivation and discipline to continue the habit.</p>
                
                    <p>You’ll find that by challenging yourself, motivation is easy to come by as long as you believe you have the ability to conquer the challenge.</p>
                
                    
                
                    <h1 class="page-header">In the end...</h1>
                
                    <p>I see a lot of people who feel that they are just unlucky, that no matter what they do they can’t seem to get what they want, and because of this they start displaying a negative attitude. They start to belittle themselves, lose hope, stop putting in effort, complain a lot, make excuses for themselves. And it upsets me. It upsets me because I want to see people succeed and because I really don’t want to surround myself with negative attitudes... Because if constantly around it, it soon starts to rub off on you. It’s inevitable. It upsets me to the point that I wish I could just give them what they want, give them a quick formula, but it’s not that easy. Nothing in the world comes easy, but people often times don’t realize that. They expect that if you put in a little bit of good work, you should expect good returns or that you need to be born lucky. But you need to consistently put in good work to get good output. Everyone is capable of accomplishing anything they put their mind to. We’re all the same. I know it sounds like a cliche, but it’s true. Why can’t you accomplish something? Why can’t you work towards it? If you believe in yourself, have that self-confidence, be strong, and work hard at it, then you can do it.</p>
                
                
                    <p><strong>Remember, you can always continue improving your mental toughness.</strong></p>
