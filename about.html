                <p>Every few months, we would meet up at a local coffee shop or house and use that time to catch up since we donâ€™t get to see each other often. But, what always happened towards the tail end of the night is that we would find ourselves in really thought-provoking discussions. Discussions about life, careers, political issues, family, etc, and they were riveting. We always learn so much from each other, and when it was time to go home we felt motivated and excited to take what we had learned and use it in our everyday lives.</p> 
                <p>The problem was that the conversations only happened every few months, the information was exclusive to those in attendance, and the the lessons and motivations we gained would fade away after a day or two because there was no forum to refer back to them in a concrete way.</p> 
                <p>As a result, we developed this medium. To provide discussions, stories, lessons, and insight to others in a relatable way.</p>
